# git_test
My first GitHub repo! I didn't put it together that I could just open my cd in VSC by doing "code ." VERY COOL
Hello Odin!

This is my learning on my own trying to get a little more comfortable with various git things.
I am trying to learn how the git commit works with the change the TOP had me do.
I don't understand. So I am doing my best to understand more. Cheers

After these changes I wrote "git status"
This file is now pink? red? when the status has been made.

I just ran "git add" that was a mistake I needed to run "git add ." to add my CD to the add

After doing the change and using "git add ."
The "git status" now has this file "README.md" in green. Therefore it is in the Staging Area as per git-scm.com

Now I understand the basics of what people mean with commits and staging. Feels nice to know.

I have commited using "git commit" and added the message

Now I'm going to try and push

I have now pushed.

I just read a little more again. What I really was an action called "push"

I will follow the above again to push all the changes I've made while typing and finish up my practice here.
